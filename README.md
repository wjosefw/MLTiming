**MLTiming** is a user-friendly and explainable machine learning tool designed to train individual gamma radiation detectors for accurate time-stamping of incoming radiation signals.

## Overview

In our innovative framework, we leverage the signals from a specific detector to enable it to produce precise time-stamps independently, eliminating the need for auxiliary or reference detectors during the training process.

## How It Works

Our approach involves utilizing pairs of radiation pulses and their corresponding delayed copies, separated by a known time interval. The machine learning model is optimized to accurately reproduce this time difference, allowing for reliable calibration of the detectors.

### Key Features

- **Independent Calibration**: Train detectors without auxiliary systems, simplifying the calibration process.
- **Fast and Reliable**: Achieve quick processing and accurate time-stamping of realistic gamma radiation influxes.
- **Explainable AI**: Our tool is designed to be transparent, providing insights into the decision-making process of the machine learning model.

## Benefits

With **MLTiming**, researchers and practitioners can efficiently calibrate gamma radiation detectors, ensuring they operate at peak performance in real-world scenarios.
